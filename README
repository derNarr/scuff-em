SCUFF-EM
========

SCUFF-EM is a free open-source software suite for boundary-element analysis of
problems in computational electromagnetism and related fields.

SCUFF-EM stands for

    Surface-CUrrent-Field Formulation of ElectroMagnetism

For documentation and further information on SCUFF-EM, and to download binary
and source packages, visit the SCUFF-EM homepage:

The SCUFF-EM distribution includes the following components:

* libscuff, a C++ library that implements the basic boundary-element
  solver functionality

* a number of ancillary C++ libraries implementing utility functions

* a collection of simple C++ code examples demonstrating how to use
  the libscuff API

* a collection of standalone application programs, built atop
  libscuff and its associated libraries, for solving specialized problems in
  computational electromagnetism and related fields.

The standalone application programs distributed with SCUFF-EM
include the following:

``scuff-scatter``:
    A comprehensive tool for computing the fields scattered from arbitrary
    geometries irradiated by arbitrary user-specified incident fields


``scuff-RF``:
    A tool for analyzing passive RF and microwave devices: RF antennas, coaxial
    cables, MRI coils, lumped-element passives, etc. scuff-RF can compute

``scuff-cas2D``, ``scuff-cas3D``, ``scuff-caspol``:
    Tools for computing Casimir forces between 2D and 3D objects of arbitrary
    geometries and material properties, as well as Casimir-Polder potentials
    for polarizable molecules in the vicinity of complex material surfaces.
